# Plant-store-templete
Java and Templetes based Plant store
Plant-a-Tree is an online store to sell gardening stuff. This project is developed with the help of java technology as a backend and html front end to interact
with the system and perform desirable actions like views plants, search plants, add to cart and buy it. User can search for any plant/tree or other gardening stuff
and buy it. User can also create his/her account on Plant-a-Tree store so that he/she can save products in card and incase want to buy it later. This feature also
helps to authenticate the user. After selecting the product user can purchase it or add into the cart. And then checkout using debit/credit card. I used java technology
at the backend of this project. Admin can manage the products and make sure the availability of the product. Product availability is also maintained. PayPal payment
gateway is also integrated in it. It allows customer to pay directly from PayPal or Debit/Credit card. All modules are tested, and test results are also given.
